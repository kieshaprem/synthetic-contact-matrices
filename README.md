## Aim
1. To update the synthetic contact matrices with the most recent data and extend our analysis to 177 geographical locations. 
2. To develop customised contact matrices for rural and urban settings. 
3. To compare both the 2017 and 2020 synthetic matrices to out-of-sample empirically-constructed contact matrices.
4. To explore the effects of using both the empirical and synthetic contact matrices when modelling physical distancing interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic using an age-stratified transmission model.
